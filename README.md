netatmo-api-python
==================

Simple API to access Netatmo weather station data from any python script
For more detailed information see http://dev.netatmo.com

I have no relation with the netatmo company, I wrote this because I needed it myself,
and published it to save time to anyone who would have same needs.


** NOTE ** Due to changes in progress in the Netatmo data storage, the API no longer works. Once theses changes will get stabilized and (we expect) a formal annoucement will be made on availability off these features, the library will be ehanced to support the new features.
